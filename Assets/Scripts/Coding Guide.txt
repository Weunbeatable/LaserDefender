Small guide intended to be used for this project to help with consistency. 

formatting: 
	2 word variables or functions camel cased. 
		•e.g. private float _healthValue;
		•e.g. public void EnemySpawner()
	3 or more word variables will be _separated
		•e.g. public string full_Name_Parser;
		•e.g. private void _Enemy_Pathing_Logic;

Variables:
All variables should start lower case. 
	• private and protected variables are preceeded with a _ 
		e.g. private int _turnValue;
	•public variables don't need to be preceeded with anything. 

Code separation: 
Namespaces will be added for subfolder types to allower for easier separation and seperation of concerns

e.g. If the folder the script is located in is Core the script will be placed into the MAIN root subfolder

e.g. UI folder has a script called backgroundScroller
	• e.g. namespace LD.UI
		{
			public class BackgroundScroller: MONOBEHAVIOUR
		}
	If a script is located in a subfolder inside a main root folder, the namespace will still be taken from the main root folder. 
	• e.g. Script names EnemyAI is located in  Enemy => EnemyAI. 
	• Enemy was the root folder so the namespace will be namespace LD.ENEMY{} (this is just an example there is no gaurantee that
	• The enemy will have its own library or that the enemy AI will stay in that folder. 

Class naming:
• All class names MUST start with a capital,
• non monobehaviour classes can be preceeded with C for some form of consistency. (though not a must)
• All interfaces must be preceeded with I e.g. IDamageable - to persist with C# standard for naming. 

Events: 
• Events will be preceeded with On
	e.g. • OnSelectedChanged;
Assets: (This isn't coding but im keeping it here until i make another text file)
Assets that are purchased and not should be separated, 
Assets that are intended for a specific platform should also be separated e.g. mobile vs WebGL 
structure will be purchased vs free then mobile vs webGL

ALL code in project is subject to review to ensure things are easier to manage
